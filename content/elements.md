**Q2: What is the factory school model?**

The factory school model is a teaching method that emerged during the Industrial Revolution. Schools were designed to resemble assembly lines, where students learned the same curriculum at the same pace. This approach is ill-suited for the AI-driven world, where students need to be adaptable, creative problem solvers, and strong collaborators.

**Q3: How has the factory school model impacted education?**

The factory school model has left a lasting impact on education systems worldwide. Many classrooms still operate under the assumption that students must follow a predetermined path and learn at the same pace, leading to a lack of flexibility and personalization. This outdated approach does not adequately prepare students for the challenges and opportunities of the AI-driven world, necessitating a paradigm shift in education.

**Q4: What skills do students need to succeed in the AI-driven world?**

The AI-driven world requires a new set of skills, including creativity, critical thinking, adaptability, and collaboration. Students must be prepared to engage in lifelong learning, as the nature of work and the skills required for success will continue to evolve. The factory school model, with its emphasis on rote memorization and conformity, is ill-suited to develop these skills.

**Q5: How can Agile and Lean principles improve education?**

Agile and Lean principles, which originated in software development and manufacturing, offer a framework for creating flexible, adaptive, and student-centered learning environments. By incorporating these principles into the classroom, educators can promote critical thinking, problem-solving, and collaboration among students. Agile and Lean principles also foster a growth mindset and a focus on continuous improvement, which are essential for lifelong learning.
